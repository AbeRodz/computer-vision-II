# Computer Vision II


***This repo is the final project of the computer vision class***

## What is this?

This project is a road segmentation project using the KITTI dataset.

## Data Augmentation

A couple of augmentation strategies were applied, the dataset on its own is fairly small with only 239 images and their masks, the following augmentations where applied:

- Horizontal Flip
- Rotation
- Random Brightness and contrast
- Random Shadow
- Random Sun flare

## Models tested

- UNET
- Deeplab V3
- UNET++

# Results

Out of the three models UNET++ performed the best in metrics and subjectively also.


***Need to update this readme***
